# OBSTACLE-DETECTION-USING-IOT

## Overview
This project demonstrates the development and implementation of an ultrasonic distance measurement system with an alert mechanism using a buzzer. The system accurately measures the distance to an obstacle and activates a buzzer if the obstacle is within 10 centimeters.

## Components
- **Arduino Uno**: The central controller of the system.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**: Measures the distance to an obstacle.
- **Piezoelectric Buzzer**: Provides an audible alert when an obstacle is detected.
- **Jumper Wires**: Establish electrical connections between components.
- **Breadboard**: Used for prototyping.
- **Power Supply**: Powers the Arduino and connected components.

## Software
- **Arduino IDE**: Used for writing, compiling, and uploading code to the Arduino board.

## Functionality
1. **Initialization**: Configures pins and sets up the Arduino board.
2. **Measurement**: The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to an obstacle.
3. **Alert Mechanism**: If the distance is less than or equal to 10 cm, the buzzer is activated.

## Setup
1. Connect the components as per the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the provided code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power the system and observe the buzzer alert when an obstacle is detected within 10 cm.

## Future Enhancements
- Improved distance measurement accuracy.
- Integration of multiple sensors for broader detection.
- Wireless communication for remote monitoring.
